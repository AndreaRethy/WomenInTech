                    <h3>Career:</h3>
                    <p>Adele Goldstine's career was closely intertwined with the development of early computers. She worked as a programmer on the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), one of the first electronic general-purpose computers. Her work involved programming the ENIAC to solve complex mathematical problems, including calculations related to the development of the hydrogen bomb.</p>
                    <p>Goldstine's collaboration with computer pioneers John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert played a crucial role in the early advancements of electronic computing. She later co-authored the book "Planning and Coding of Problems for an Electronic Computing Instrument," which provided insights into the programming techniques used for the ENIAC.</p>
