                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. Born on December 9, 1906, in New York City, she developed an early interest in mathematics. Hopper earned her bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics from Vassar College in 1928. She later completed her master's and doctoral degrees in mathematics at Yale University in 1930 and 1934, respectively.</p>

                    <h3 class="select">Career:</h3>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Grace Hopper's career was marked by pioneering contributions to the field of computer science and software development. During World War II, she joined the United States Navy and worked on the Harvard Mark I computer, one of the earliest electromechanical computers. Her programming innovations included developing the first compiler, known as the A-0 system, which translated symbolic mathematical code into machine code.</p>
                        <p>In the post-war era, Hopper continued her work in computing, contributing to the development of the UNIVAC I computer and coining the term "bug" to describe a computer malfunction. She played a pivotal role in the development of COBOL (COmmon Business-Oriented Language), a high-level programming language designed for business and data processing.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Grace Hopper received numerous accolades for her groundbreaking work. She was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in the U.S. Navy, becoming one of the few women to reach such a high rank. In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology for her contributions to the development of computer programming languages.</p>
                        <p>Hopper's impact on the field of computer science was further recognized with the creation of the Grace Murray Hopper Award, presented annually by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).</p>
