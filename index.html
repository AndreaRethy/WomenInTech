            <h2>Women Who Changed the Tech World</h2>
            <p>Who wrote the first computer program? Who invented Wi-Fi? Who came up with the idea of the first machine-independent programming language?</p>
            <p>Tech - traditionally viewed as a field for men proves we give little thought to the history that is showing us otherwise. Women very much do belong in the tech world as well! Below we are going to commemorate some of the great women who's achievements changed the history of the tech world.</p>

                            <h3>First Computer Program</h3>
                            <p>Born: Ada Byron, 10 December 1815 in London, England</p>
                            <p>Died: 27 November 1852</p>
                            <p>Ada was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.</p>
                            <p>Ada Lovelace</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="card-back">
                            <h3>Ada Lovelace</h3>
                            <h4>First Computer Program</h4>
                            <p>When she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father of computers". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine.</p>
                            <p>Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by the military engineer Luigi Menabrea (later Prime Minister of Italy) about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of seven notes, simply called &#34;Notes&#34;.</p>
                            <p>Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, especially since the seventh one contained what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine.</p>
                            <p>She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.</p>

                            <p>Born: March 12, 1939, in Washington, D.C., USA</p>
                            <p>Died: July 19, 2003</p>
                            <p>Jude best known by her pseudonym  **St. Jude** , was a self-taught programmer, civil rights advocate, writer, editor, advocate for women in computing, hacker and author.</p>
                            <p>Milhon coined the term cypherpunk and was a founding member of the cypherpunks.</p>

                            <h4>Advocate for women in computing</h4>
                            <p>Milhon taught herself programming in 1967 and landed her first job at the Horn and Hardart vending machine company of New York before she moved away to California to join the counterculture movement. She worked at the Berkeley Computer Company (an outgrowth of Project Genie), and she helped implement the communications controller of the BCC timesharing system. In 1971 she partnered with other local activists and technologists at Project One, where she was particularly drawn to the Resource One project, with the goal of creating the Bay Area's first public computerized bulletin board system.</p>
                            <p>In 1973, a subset of the Resource One group, including Milhon, broke away to create Community Memory in Berkeley. Later, she also worked on BSD, a Unix-based operating system developed by the Computer Systems Research Group at UC Berkeley.</p>
                            <p>She was a member of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility], and the author of several books. She was a senior editor at the magazine Mondo 2000 and frequent contributor to Boing Boing.</p>

                            <p>Born: Rózsa Politzer, 17 February 1905 in Budapest, Hungary</p>
                            <p>Died: 16 February 1977</p>
                            <p>Rózsa was a Hungarian mathematician and logician. She is best known as the "founding mother of recursion theory". Beginning in the mid-1950s, Péter applied recursive function theory to computers. Her final book, published in 1976, was Recursive Functions in Computer Theory. Originally published in Hungarian, it was the second Hungarian mathematical book to be published in the Soviet Union because its subject matter was considered indispensable to the theory of computers. It was translated into English in 1981.</p>

                            <h3>Rózsa Péter</h3>
                            <h4>Founding mother of recursion theory</h4>
                            <p>Péter presented the results of her paper on recursive theory, "*Rekursive Funktionen*", to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich, Switzerland in 1932. In the summer of 1933, she worked with Paul Bernays in Göttingen, Germany, for the long chapter on recursive functions in the book *Grundlagen der Mathematik* that appeared in 1934 under the names of David Hilbert and Bernays. Her main results are summarised in the book and also appeared in several articles in the leading journal of mathematics, the *Mathematische Annalen*, the first in 1934. Publication was under the name Politzer-Péter as she had changed her Jewish surname Politzer into Péter that same year. In 1936, she presented a paper entitled "*Über rekursive Funktionen der zweiten Stufe*" to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo. These papers helped to found the modern field of recursive function theory as a separate area of mathematical research.</p>
                            <p>During World War II, she wrote her book  *Playing with Infinity: Mathematical Explorations and Excursions* , a work for lay readers on the topics of number theory and logic.</p>
                            <p>In 1951, she published her key work  *Rekursive Funktionen*, the first book on modern logic by a female author, later translated into English as  *Recursive Functions* . She continued to publish important papers on recursive theory throughout her life. In 1959, she presented a major paper "*Über die Verallgemeinerung der Theorie der rekursiven Funktionen für abstrakte Mengen geeigneter Struktur als Definitionsbereiche*" to the International Symposium in Warsaw (later published in two parts in 1961 and 1962).</p>

                            <p>Born: Adele Katz, December 21, 1920 in New York City, USA</p>
                            <p>Died: November 1964</p>
                            <p>Adele was an American mathematician and computer programmer. She wrote the manual for the first electronic digital computer, ENIAC. Through her work programming the computer, she was also an instrumental player in converting the ENIAC from a computer that needed to be reprogrammed each time it was used to one that was able to perform a set of fifty stored instructions.</p>
                            <p>Adele Goldstine</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="card-back">
                            <h3>Adele Goldstine</h3>
                            <h4>First working manual for ENIAC</h4>
                            <p>As an instructor of mathematics for the women "computers" at the Moore School, Goldstine also trained some of the six women who were the original programmers of ENIAC to manually calculate ballistic trajectories (complex differential calculations). The job of computer was critical to the war effort, and women were regarded as capable of doing the work more rapidly and accurately than men. By 1943, and for the balance of World War II, essentially all computers were women as were many of their direct supervisors.</p>
                            <p>Goldstine wrote the Operators Manual for the ENIAC. Reconfiguring the machine to solve a different problem involved physically plugging and unplugging wires on the machine; it was called "setting-up," as the modern terminology of "program" had not yet come into use.</p>
                            <p>In 1946 Goldstine sat in on programming sessions with Bartik and Dick Clippinger and was hired to help implement Clippinger's stored program modification to the ENIAC. John von Neumann was a consultant on the selection of the instruction set implemented. This solved the problem of the programmers having to unplug and replug patch cables for every program the machine was to run; instead the program was entered on the three function tables, which had previously been used only for storage of a trajectory's drag function.</p>
                            <p>After the war, Goldstine continued her programming work with von Neumann at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where she devised problems for ENIAC to process.</p>

                <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>
                <h3>First Computer Program</h3>
                <p>When she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father of computers". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine.</p>
                <p>Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by the military engineer Luigi Menabrea (later Prime Minister of Italy) about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of seven notes, simply called &#34;Notes&#34;.</p>
                <p>Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, especially since the seventh one contained what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine.</p>
                <p>She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.</p>

                <h2>Jude Milhon</h2>
                <h3>Advocate for women in computing</h3>
                <p>Milhon taught herself programming in 1967 and landed her first job at the Horn and Hardart vending machine company of New York before she moved away to California to join the counterculture movement. She worked at the Berkeley Computer Company (an outgrowth of Project Genie), and she helped implement the communications controller of the BCC timesharing system. In 1971 she partnered with other local activists and technologists at Project One, where she was particularly drawn to the Resource One project, with the goal of creating the Bay Area's first public computerized bulletin board system.</p>
                <p>In 1973, a subset of the Resource One group, including Milhon, broke away to create Community Memory in Berkeley. Later, she also worked on BSD, a Unix-based operating system developed by the Computer Systems Research Group at UC Berkeley.</p>
                <p>She was a member of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility], and the author of several books. She was a senior editor at the magazine Mondo 2000 and frequent contributor to Boing Boing.</p>

                <h2>Rózsa Péter</h2>
                <h3>Founding mother of recursion theory</h3>
                <p>Péter presented the results of her paper on recursive theory, "*Rekursive Funktionen*", to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich, Switzerland in 1932. In the summer of 1933, she worked with Paul Bernays in Göttingen, Germany, for the long chapter on recursive functions in the book *Grundlagen der Mathematik* that appeared in 1934 under the names of David Hilbert and Bernays. Her main results are summarised in the book and also appeared in several articles in the leading journal of mathematics, the *Mathematische Annalen*, the first in 1934. Publication was under the name Politzer-Péter as she had changed her Jewish surname Politzer into Péter that same year. In 1936, she presented a paper entitled "*Über rekursive Funktionen der zweiten Stufe*" to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo. These papers helped to found the modern field of recursive function theory as a separate area of mathematical research.</p>
                <p>During World War II, she wrote her book  *Playing with Infinity: Mathematical Explorations and Excursions* , a work for lay readers on the topics of number theory and logic.</p>
                <p>In 1951, she published her key work  *Rekursive Funktionen*, the first book on modern logic by a female author, later translated into English as  *Recursive Functions* . She continued to publish important papers on recursive theory throughout her life. In 1959, she presented a major paper "*Über die Verallgemeinerung der Theorie der rekursiven Funktionen für abstrakte Mengen geeigneter Struktur als Definitionsbereiche*" to the International Symposium in Warsaw (later published in two parts in 1961 and 1962).</p>

                <h2>Adele Goldstine</h2>
                <h3>First working manual for ENIAC</h3>
                <p>As an instructor of mathematics for the women "computers" at the Moore School, Goldstine also trained some of the six women who were the original programmers of ENIAC to manually calculate ballistic trajectories (complex differential calculations). The job of computer was critical to the war effort, and women were regarded as capable of doing the work more rapidly and accurately than men. By 1943, and for the balance of World War II, essentially all computers were women as were many of their direct supervisors.</p>
                <p>Goldstine wrote the Operators Manual for the ENIAC. Reconfiguring the machine to solve a different problem involved physically plugging and unplugging wires on the machine; it was called "setting-up," as the modern terminology of "program" had not yet come into use.</p>
                <p>In 1946 Goldstine sat in on programming sessions with Bartik and Dick Clippinger and was hired to help implement Clippinger's stored program modification to the ENIAC. John von Neumann was a consultant on the selection of the instruction set implemented. This solved the problem of the programmers having to unplug and replug patch cables for every program the machine was to run; instead the program was entered on the three function tables, which had previously been used only for storage of a trajectory's drag function.</p>
                <p>After the war, Goldstine continued her programming work with von Neumann at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where she devised problems for ENIAC to process.</p>
